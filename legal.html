            <p>This page covers the main legal documents you should know about before interacting with my website or its features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Please keep in mind that these documents apply to my website, products, projects, and services. I may occasionally link 3rd party sites such as Google, YouTube, Gumroad, etc. for various intents and purposes, and each 3rd party site has its own policies, terms, conditions, rules, and guidelines that I have no control over and that I am not responsible for in any way, shape, or form. I highly advise all users to carefully overview these 3rd-party legal documents before interacting with their content to avoid unwanted consequences of ignorance or lack of research.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3 id="privacy"><b>§I - Privacy Policy</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost, this website DOES NOT collect any user data by itself. All data I do collect and store is exclusively voluntarily provided by the user. Moreover, this website DOES NOT utilize cookies or any other data collection, tracking, or storing technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All collected data is stored in my local "User Registry." I keep this registry away from any servers or online directories to ensure the highest degree of privacy and security; however, despite these measures, I still cannot guarantee full security over the stored data. In case of a data breach, I will inform all relevant parties of said breach as soon as I detect it and try to resolve the situation as quickly and amicably as possible. I advise all users affected by the breach to not respond to any messages they may receive from the breachers and report them to their local authorities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Users whose data is stored in my registry have full control over their data to view, add, modify, and delete any or all of it. To do so, all they have to do is contact me via my primary email address found <a href="contact">on this page</a>, preferably through the same email stored in my registry. I will require ownership verification, the method of which may vary from user to user, after which they have full access to their data within my registry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When it comes to the data I do collect, I only collect what is strictly necessary for either contacting the users or providing them with adequate customer service. Generally, I will only keep this data stored for as long as required for business or legal purposes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I will never, under any circumstances, sell or share any stored data with any 3rd parties, unless strictly required for legal reasons.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="terms"><b>§II - Terms & Conditions</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p>By visiting this website, using its services, or interacting with its content, the users are strictly required to follow and be bound by this document.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The only safe, legal, and legitimate way of acquiring my products or services is through my website and 3rd-party stores officially approved and linked by me. I have no way of forcing users to only use these sources and avoid piracy; however, I am not responsible for any damages that may arise from illicitly acquiring my products or services from unverified sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Selling or distributing my projects, products, or services without my approval is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action. All projects, products, and services featured on this website or linked 3rd-party websites are solely my property, and unauthorized duplication and/or ownership infringement of said content is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As also noted on my home page, I work on a basis of mutual respect; hence, I reserve the right to ignore user messages that do not abide by this rule.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some content on this website may be age-restricted. More information on specific content's age restrictions can be found on said content's dedicated page. As for data collection, I will never knowingly collect data of users below the age of 18 without their parent's or guardian's consent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, please keep in mind that I am not responsible for any issues or damages that may occur or be caused by unforeseeable or uncontrollable events, such as server issues, third-party issues, government bans, natural disasters, and other similar events.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I find that any user content violates these documents, I reserve the right to take legal action. I aim to resolve all such conflicts privately and amicably, but if the situation escalates, it will be resolved according to the Republic of Croatia's judiciary laws and statutes unless agreed upon otherwise.</p>

            <h3 id="refund"><b>§III - Refund Policy</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, all my products are sold on my dedicated Gumroad website, which can be accessed <a href="https://robertrfg.gumroad.com/" target="_blank">through this link</a>. As such, all purchases are technically subject to two refund policies. The first one is my refund policy, noted below, for which the user contacts me directly, but the other is Gumroad's refund policy, which is also noted below but can also be found <a href="https://gumroad.com/help/article/51-what-is-gumroads-refund-policy" target="_blank">here</a>. The second refund policy acts as a safeguard by Gumroad to prevent chargebacks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My refund policy allows users to request a full refund within 14 days from making their purchase. To request a refund, users should first contact me through my primary email address found <a href="contact">on this page</a>, and I will issue a full refund as long as the below criteria are met:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The user contacts me through the same email address used to make the purchase.</li>
                <li>The user provides their purchase ID, which can be found on their receipt.</li>
                <li>The user contacts me before the 14-day period ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>In case I do not respond to the request within 30 days, the customer is advised to contact Gumroad directly, and they will issue a full refund on my behalf.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Gumroad's refund policy states that, to avoid chargebacks, they may issue a full refund to the customer within 90 days of making the purchase. Gumroad recommends first contacting the seller, in this case me, and if I do not cooperate in accordance with my own refund policy, only then should the user reach out to Gumroad directly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I reserve the right to deny a refund request if it violates my or Gumroad's policies, terms, conditions, rules, and guidelines, or if required by law.</p>
