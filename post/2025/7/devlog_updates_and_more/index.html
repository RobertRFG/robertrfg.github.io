            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm well aware of the fact that I haven't written anything here for well over a month, and that is because I've been hard at work on not just my game but also my website, which I have enriched with a plethora of both functional and stylistic improvements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, firstly, regarding my game, Project Debut, the idea at first was for the player to just be a floating pair of hands, for which I made all the models, textures, and animations; however, recently, I decided to scrap that entirely and opt-in to use a full-body model, which I have finally finished. I started by making a base human model and then added modular attachments to the model to add diversity between different characters without having to remodel them every time. Now, all that is left to do is to add the character textures to the player model and animate all the different poses, movements, and actions, which shouldn't be too difficult, as the hardest part, being modeling and rigging, is already done. It is a slight shame how I have wasted a few months on the 'floating arms' idea before scrapping it altogether, but I truly believe that this was the right call to make.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As for my website, when I initially wrote the code for it, I wanted it to look modern with a tint of 'retro amateur,' which I think I succeeded at; however, since then, I decided to lean more towards 'modern' and 'professional' than 'goofy' and 'amateur'; thus, I completely revamped some aspects while slightly adjusting others. You can take a gander at how my old website design looked:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="image_frame">
                <img src="img/old_website.webp" alt="old_website">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>And how my new website design looks:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="image_frame">
                <img src="img/new_website.webp" alt="new_website">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>From the images, you can see that the navigation bar has been completely changed in favor of a smaller, more compact, and minimalistic design. The footer has been adjusted for a more mobile-friendly design with the intent for all its text and links to be at the center for ease of access. The text selection color has also been changed from a solid black color to a transparent magenta, which, personally, adds more 'zest' to it. Finally, the biggest change made is the actual home page. Before, the whole homepage was basically a massive infodump, while in the new version, I compressed the main parts from the first version into three simple and intuitive colored cards. As a side note, the default button style was also changed to:</p>
            <br>
            <div>
                <button><a href="../../6/project_debut/img/goofy_gato.webp" target="_blank">I'm a &lt;button&gt;!</a></button>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This is how the default button will look like unless stated otherwise with:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">
                <div id="line">
                    <h4>1</h4>
                    <h4>2</h4>
                    <h4>3</h4>
                </div>
                <div id="code">
                    <h4><span id="div">.element</span> <span id="el">button</span> { <span id="comment">/* Custom style */</span> }</h4>
                    <h4><span id="comment">/* Or by ID: */</span></h4>
                    <h4><span id="id">#custom_button</span> { <span id="comment">/* Custom style */</span> }</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>I'm sure you noticed the new fancy image frame, which looks rather sophisticated, if I do say so myself, as well as the new code window preview, which I intend to use later down the line. Mobile screens have also received a refresher, as I have changed the navigation menu there too from:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="image_frame" id="small">
                <img src="img/o_web_r.webp" alt="old_website_responsive">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>To:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="image_frame" id="small">
                <img src="img/n_web_r.webp" alt="new_website_responsive">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div class="image_frame" id="small">
                <img src="img/n_web_rm.webp" alt="new_website_responsive_menu">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>And with that, we round up all the major website changes. Other adjustments include, but are not limited to, minor spacing tweaking, code optimization, content optimization,  removing redundant material, and so on. And with that, that wraps up this monthly article. :D</p>
            <br>
            <p>As always, I am always open for suggestions and constructive criticism, so if you have any of that, feel free to reach out <a href="../../../../support">here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Until next time, cheers!</p>
