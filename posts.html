                <br><hr><br>
                <p>The Blog has been replaced by Posts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The reason behind this decision is that Posts allow me to be more universal as to what I write and publish here, as opposed to Blog posts, which were strictly long-form, monthly articles. Posts also allow me to stack them all on this one page instead of having to create separate directories for each, saving both space, time, and reducing complexity. Each post comes with its own unique ID (in this case, "6014431"), which can be used to directly jump to said article by the method of adding #ID to the end of the URL. For example, <a href="https://robertrfg.com/posts#6014431" target="_blank">https://robertrfg.com/posts#6014431</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By extension, this means the Blog post that carried the same name as this post ("Project Debut") was also purged from my website. In essence, that Blog post introduced my game, my approach to making that game, and compared my game to Ground Branch, another similar title.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With this in mind, this post is basically a rewritten version of the now-purged Blog post.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Project Debut is a temporary placeholder name for my debut game. My goal is to make a fun, immersive, performance-oriented, and affordable tactical shooter, similar to the likes of Ready or Not, Zero Hour, and Ground Branch. The key points I will focus on with this game are:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Quality over Quantity</li>
                    <li>Performance</li>
                    <li>Price</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Quality over Quantity</h3>
                <br>
                <p>An unfortunate trend plaguing the game development and publishing landscape is the tendency to prioritize more stuff over better stuff.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Case in point: Ground Branch. The game features over 40 "different" weapons to use; however, if you compared every weapon from each category, you'd find that if you've played with one SMG, you've played with them all; if you've played with one AK, you've played with them all; if you've played with one assault rifle, you've played with them all. You get the point. The biggest in-category difference between weapons is the sniper category, which actually has decent diversity of actually different weapons, from bolt-action to semi-automatic.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, my approach will be to create a single weapon from each category and apply it to the specific faction that weapon is intended for. This approach reduces development time, removes redundancy, and gives players an actual reason to use one weapon over another, aside from one weapon just looking better than the other, of course.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And this is not to say that I'm trashing Ground Branch or claiming it's a bad game. I'm simply comparing the approach Ground Branch took, which is great for LARPing, and my approach, which is more optimal for productivity, performance, and practicality.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Performance</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A similar issue that is somewhat tied to the aforementioned point is performance, which, nowadays, seems to be an afterthought at best. Who cares if we have graphics indistinguishable from reality or if we can see how every muscle in some animal's body deforms when the majority of people won't even be able to experience that at more than 15 FPS? Being able to run the game is not the same as being able to actually play it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My answer to this is to keep everything simple. From simple models to simple textures to simple animations, allowing me to focus on what actually matters: gameplay, stability, and performance. Not to mention how stylized visuals, like the poly style, are practically timeless. A poly game from 10 years ago looks just as good now as it did then, and as it will in 10 years' time. Same cannot be said for hyper-realistic visuals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And yes, I'm well aware that this sort of style isn't for everyone; that is completely fine. And I also understand that a portion of the tactical shooter community prefers their games to be as immersively realistic as possible, which I also understand; however, games like that already exist (Ground Branch and Ready or Not, just to name a few). I want to provide an option for people who may not have the PC specs required to play something like Ready or Not, or who want a more affordable alternative, or who simply want a stylized take on the genre.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>3. Price</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Average prices of video games keep increasing year-by-year, while yielding little to no justification for the actual increase in price. First it was 30€, then 50€, then 70€, and now it's getting closer and closer to 100€+. Now, value is subjective, and a 20-hour-long experience not being worth 60€ for me doesn't mean it isn't worth 60€ for you. Therefore, take the following paragraph with a grain of subjective salt.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a consumer, I understand that most people are forced to pick and choose which game they'll buy and which they'll put on their Wishlist for the next few months before it goes on some major sale. I see that as a massive problem, and, as such, I will address it by using community feedback to set a fair and affordable price for my game according to its value. Currently, I'm thinking 15€, but that is subject to change.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I also made a video talking about my game and these points over on my YouTube channel:</p>
